Network analysis
================

This page gives an overview of the network analysis functionality of sgis. The analysis
methods are found in the NetworkAnalysis class. This class takes a network in the form
of a Network or DirectedNetwork instance. Using a Network instance will make the
analyses undirected. The NetworkAnalysis class also takes a set of rules in the form of
a NetworkAnalysisRules instance. See examples in the subsections of this page.
