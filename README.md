## Developer information

### Git LFS

The data in the testdata directory is stored with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/).
Make sure `git-lfs` is installed and that you have run the command `git lfs install`
at least once. You only need to run this once per user account.

### Dependencies

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used for dependency management. Install
poetry and run the command below from the root directory to install the dependencies.

```shell
poetry install --no-root
```

### Tests

Use the following command from the root directory to run the tests:

```shell
poetry run pytest  # from root directory
```

### Formatting

Format the code with `black` and `isort` by running the following command from the
root directory:

```shell
poetry run black .
poetry run isort .
```

### Pre-commit hooks

We are using [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to make sure the code is
correctly formatted and consistent before committing. Use the following command from
the root directory in the repo to install the pre-commit hooks:

```shell
poetry run pre-commit install
```

It then checks the changed files before committing. You can run the pre-commit checks
on all files by using this command:

```shell
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```
